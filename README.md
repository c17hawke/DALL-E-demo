## DALL-E API can perform the following as of now -

1. Image generation by text prompts
2. Image variations by passing an image
3. Image edits by text prompts and a mask image

## Make sure you create `.env` file to keep the openai API key safe

`.env` should contain the following -

```ini
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```
